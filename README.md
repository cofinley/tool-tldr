# Tool TL;DR

This is an old project I'm adding to the portfolio.

It was an attempt to fill a niche which I found myself wanting: a place to learn about libraries, frameworks, and tools in a simple, TL;DR way.

I was learning web development and there was a lot to digest in terms of third-party software. What did each one do? How did it differ from the others? Was this even applicable to my project. Sometimes, software's value-prop is shrouded in marketing, poor documentation, etc. I wanted a way to cut through the smoke and see where each one fit in my mental map.

I figured a wiki would be a good platform for this: I don't know all the tools, things update all the time, and explanations can usually benefit from clarification from another person.

However, searching for white-label, programmable wiki frameworks didn't turn up much. So I started down the path of building my own wiki engine. One that could manage content, content updates/diffs, users, tagging, hierarchical structures, and more.

It took some time but I finally released it to the public. The end result was still pretty simple and my marketing skills were pretty bad, so it never took off like I'd hoped.

But it wasn't a loss. I learned an enormous amount about web application development, from user administration to server management, to security practices, and database performance. I also got extra credit for it as an independent study at university.

As I grew more experienced, I also realized I didn't have the needs this application filled as much anymore. I could then reason about libraries and their purpose by doing some cursory inspections. This project set out to aid newer developers and build their mental maps.

I am leaving this on my GitHub to give some color/perspective to my earlier days. There are things I'm probably embarrassed about in the commits, but that's part of it.
